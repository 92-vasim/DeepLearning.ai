1. Guidelines:
    1) Prompting Principles
        a. Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
        b. Principle 2: Give the model time to "think"
    
        A. Tactics:
            
            1. Tactic 1: Use delemiters to clearly indicate distint parts of the input 
                exp: Delemiters can be anything like: ``, "", <>, <tag> </tag>

            2. Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
                exp: Json, Html 

            3. Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
                exp: steps in prompt 

            4. Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting 
                exp: In this prompt, some examples are given to model to do the job with respective to example

    2) Principle 2: Give the model time to "think" 

        A. Tactics:

            a) Tactic 1: Specify  the steps required to complete a task 
            or Tactic 2: Ask for output in specified format.

            b) Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion 

        Note: The student's solution is actually not correct 
        We can fix this by instructing the model to work out its own solution first.  

2. Iterative Prompt Development
    => Generate marketing product description from a product fact sheet.

    => Issues:
        a. The text is too long 
            - Limit the number of words/sentences/characters

        b. Text focuses on the wrong details 
            - Ask it to focus on the aspects that are relevant to the intended audience.
        
        c. Description needs a table of dimensions
            - Ask it to extract information and organize it in a table. 


3. Summarizing

    => Text to summarize 
    => Summarize with a word/sentence/character limit 
    => Summarize with a focus on shipping and delivery
    => Summarize with a focus on price and value
    => Try "extract" instead of "summarize"
    => Summaraize multiple product reviews

4. Inferring

    => Product review text 
    => Sentiment (positive/negetive)
    => Identify types of emotions
    => Identify anger 
    => Extract product and company name from customer reviews 
    => Doing multiple tasks at once 
    => Inferring topics 
    => Infer 5 topics 
    => Make a news alert for certain topics 


5. Transforming

    => Translation
    => Universal translator 

6. Expanding

    => Customize the automated reply to a customer email 
    => Remind the model to use details from the customer's email 


7. Chatbot
